# UK Education Insights

## Overview
Analyzing Key Stage 4 (GCSE) outcomes for disadvantaged students across England to identify which school-level factors most strongly correlate with success. This project aims to surface evidence-based insights that school leaders, local authorities, and policymakers can act on.

## Research Question
**What non-academic factors most strongly predict whether Pupil Premium students achieve Grade 5+ in English & Maths?**

With persistent absence rates doubling post-pandemic (from 10.9% in 2018/19 to 20.0% in 2023/24), understanding the relationship between attendance, school characteristics, and outcomes is critical for closing the disadvantage gap.

## Data Sources
- **Key Stage 4 Performance Data (2023/24)** - DfE school-level GCSE results
- **Pupil Absence Statistics (2023/24)** - Persistent absence rates by school
- All data from UK Department for Education official statistics

## Methodology
Correlation analysis and regression modeling to identify which factors predict outcomes for disadvantaged students, with focus on:
- Persistent absence rates
- Pupil Premium eligibility
- Progress 8 scores
- School characteristics

## Impact Goal
Generate actionable insights that can inform resource allocation decisions in schools serving disadvantaged communities.
